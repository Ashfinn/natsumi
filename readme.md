Rewatch Non Non Biyori in a unique order.
__________
This is a Python script I made to spice up my 100th Non Non Biyori Rewatch experience.

## Usage
Run the excecutable.

## Output:
The script will output the next episode to watch and update the watched_episodes.csv and unwatched_episodes.csv files accordingly.

## Example CSV Structure
All the csv files have the following structure:

```Season,Episode,Title
Season 1, Episode 1, Title 1
1,2,Episode Title 2
...
```
